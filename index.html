				<p>Stepped into the bright side
				I got time, time on my side
				Baby you on my team
				Grass is green, know what I mean Stepped into the bright side
				I got time, time on my side Baby you on my team Grass is green
				
				Stepped into the bright side
				I got time, time on my side
				Baby you on my team
				Grass is green, know what I mean Stepped into the bright side
				I got time, time on my side
				Baby you on my team
				Grass is green, know what I mean

				Man, some people live like they’re Written by Kubrick
				Walking round to a soundtrack
				Of orchestral music
				I was jelly of these plots
				Cos I thought they were greener Wondering, wheres my pool
				And my brand new beemer
				See, I had to trust
				Hope that it’d be fine
				I’m getting better with age
				Like Italian wine
				Feel so damn lucky I’ma hit the casino Have my baby kiss my dice
				Just because it routine
				But I already won, I already got the jackpot

				Now the skies are blue Never seemed so clear I’ll fall like the sun Then I’ll rise again

				Now the skies so blue Never did seem so clear
				I’ll disappear like the moon Then I’ll come around again

				Stepped into the bright side
				I got time, time on my side
				Baby you on my team
				Grass is green, know what I mean Stepped into the bright side
				I got time, time on my side
				Baby you on my team
				Grass is green, know what I mean
				
				Gotta count your blessings
				Out of every little lesson
				That I learned between detentions It was always sentimental ones that Really spoke something to me Gotta poke fun at every
				Little broke bit cos it’ll go
				I switched gears, let out my tears And started looking
				Once I could see the future
				I finally started
				Booking up my time
				With people I’d rather see
				Started going to the places
				That I’d rather be

				Found out what’s important what
				Keeps my grass so green
				People that I needed like
				Need y’all on my team
				Listened for the sweeter sounds
				Living in a dream
				Mama I’m coming home
				Mama I’m coming home
